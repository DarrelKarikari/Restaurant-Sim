# Restaurant-Sim

# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer

## Project Description
Using this restaurant simulator, users may design their own menu and interact with it through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), from which they can print a physical receipt. The project calls independent classes to construct functionality and uses a PrinterJob API to use the Windows OS printing system in order to achieve this GUI. Java's abstract classes and inheritance functionality are also utilised in this process.

Using core OOP concepts like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation with ease is what this project aims to demonstrate.

This project was a requirement for my university's CP213 course, which included a final project using Java JFrame.
